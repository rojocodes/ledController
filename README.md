# ledController

This is an arduino project which lets you connect a ws2812 neopixel led strip over wifi using a webpage.
It works over a socket connection.
The data folder contains all the files compressed which are needed for showing the web page and the various js files.
The files folder contains all the html files in uncompressed form.

I have used iro js(https://iro.js.org/introduction.html) for showing the color wheel so credit goes to the creator.
